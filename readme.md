If you use <a>Google</> Docs or Presentations and share your work with others, giving them a link directly to the part of your slideshow or paper you want them to see makes it easier for you to get the feedback you need and for them to find what you need them to read. Here's how to do it.

Amit Agarwal over at Digital Inspiration shared these methods of linking to specific paragraphs and slides in a Google document or presentation. In Google Docs, you'll need to create a bookmark at the paragraph you want to share first:

Open your document and scroll down to the paragraph you want to link to.
Click the Insert menu in Google Docs and select "Bookmark."
You'll see a bookmark ribbon at the beginning of the paragraph, with links next to it for "Link" and "Remove."
Right-click the "Link" to copy it to your clipboard, or click it to open it, then copy it from your browser's address bar.
Email or IM the link to a friend!
For a specific slide in a Google Presentation, the process is similar, but even easier:

Open your presentation and go to the slide you want to share.
Copy the URL from your browser's address bar. Each slide in a slideshow has its own unique, permanent URL that's loaded when you change slides.
Email or IM the link to a friend!
That's all there is to it. Again, the URL may be a little long because the document ID can get pretty big, especially if you're using Google Apps for your domain and not just Google Drive with your Google account, but it works like a charm. At the end of the URL, you'll see an anchor (after the # symbol) that's the specific pointer to the part of the document or slideshow you're sharing. That's how Google Drive knows exactly where to send the person you give the link to.
